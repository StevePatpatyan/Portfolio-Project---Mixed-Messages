## About

The goal of this portfolio project was to generate randomly chosen messages to the user. I took inspiration from one of my favorite video game franchises of all time, NBA2K, and decided to generate a fictional basketball player with a random name and random general stats, and display it to the user along with the average overall rating.

## What Is Calculated And Output

* The player's first and last name (randomly chosen from a list of famous players' first and last names, separately)
* The player's outside scoring rating (from 0 to 99, inclusive)
* The player's inside scoring rating (from 0 to 99, inclusive)
* The player's defense rating (from 0 to 99, inclusive)
* The player's athleticism rating (from 0 to 99, inclusive)
* The player's playmaking rating (from 0 to 99, inclusive)
* The player's rebounding rating (from 0 to 99, inclusive)
* The player's overall rating (calculated by summing up all of the stats above and dividing by the total number of stats)
